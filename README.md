Styles:

* General styles based on the idea of older notecards you might see recipes on.

* Dark gray (pencil lead) text #444444 on lightly yellowed paper #f5e7a2

* The first/most prominent horizontal line on each UI is slightly thicker (3px) and red #ff5353

* Other horizontal lines are thinner (2px) blue #5353ff


Gallery items (features, recipes, team members) fit in two columns on medium/large displays, one column on mobile.

On very large displays, stop growing the main container and show background images instead.
